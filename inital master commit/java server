JDBC (Java Databse Connectivity) is an advancement for ODBC (Open Database Connectivity), is a standard API for moving data backend. It basicaly acts as an interface ( not a java interface) or channecl between Java and the database



CONNECTING JAVA AND THE DATABASE

1. Load ethe driver
    - 


2. create conncetion
    user – username from which your sql command prompt can be accessed.
    password – password from which your sql command prompt can be accessed.
    con: is a reference to Connection interface.
    url : Uniform Resource Locator. It can be created as follows:

3. Create a statement

4. Excute Query
5. cose connectiions





import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;

public class DATABASE {
    Class.forName("oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver");
    Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);

    //con: is a reference to Connection interface.
    //url : Uniform Resource Locator. It can be created as follows:
    String url = "jbdc:orcale:thin:@localhost:1521:xe";
    // where ocra databse is used, thin is the driver used, @localhost is the IP address of stored database, 1521 is port number, xe is service provider

    Statement st = con.createStatement();
    // JDBCStament, CallableStatment, and PreparedStatement define mothed s ton send SQL commonds and data

    int m = st.executeUpdate(sql);
    if (m==1)
        System.out.println("inserted successfully : "+sql);
    else
        System.out.println("insertion failed");
}
